# Clockwork

## About

This project is a Unity Project for a Game Jam \@ MacEwan from November 8-10, 2019.

Topic: Clockwork

## Description

It is a platformer involving ghosts. You control the player (robot) with the arrow keys or the a, d, w keys.


# TODO

- [ ] NullRef Error (I think it has to do with changing scenes)
- [ ] Finish Levels
- [ ] Change camera
- [ ] Collect clock sound (it cuts out b/c scene switch maybe?)
- [ ] Title Screen (with credits, opitions?, controls)
- [ ] Pause and music slider
- [ ] Fancy Designs

## Story

Joe broke the clock. Now it's your job as a robot mechanic to fix the **Clock of Causality**. The **Clock of Causality** upholds the space-time continuum and if you do not fix the clock soon, "everyone dies, the end" - Patrick.

TL;DR

Something "wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff" happened and you must collect all 12 pieces to fix the **Clock of Causality**.

## Controls

* Use A, W, D keys or Left, Right, Up arrow key (or both) to move
* Space key for **"soul jumping"**
