# Clockwork

## About

This project is a Unity Project for a Game Jam \@ MacEwan from November 8-10, 2019.

It is a platformer involving ghosts. You control the player (robot) with the arrow keys or the asdw keys (s and down doesn't do anything (yet...)).

Topic: Clockwork

## Story

Joe broke the clock. Now it's your job as a robot mechanic to fix the **Clock of Causality**. The **Clock of Causality** upholds the space-time continuum and if you do not fix the clock soon, "everyone dies" - Patrick.

TL;DR

Something "wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff" happened and you must collect all 12 pieces to fix the **Clock of Causality**.
